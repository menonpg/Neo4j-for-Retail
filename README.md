# Neo4j-for-Retail

This paper outlines how the online retail industry has benefited from using Neo4j over common relational database management systems to maintain their connected data resources to build intelligent applications for their customers. These applications are important in terms of being able to provide the company with competitive advantage in an industry that is in constant flux. 

Going further beyond, I have also benchmarked the query performance of a popular RDBMS, MySQL against that of Neo4j in the context of a product recommendation engine.
